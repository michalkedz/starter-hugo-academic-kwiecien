#### Brief description:
Cybersecurity mini-Lab is part of Department of Software Engineering Laboratory (K7) at Department of Computer Science and Management, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. It was establish to expedite Department research in area of Computer Securuity.

#### Head:  
Michal Kedziora, PhD

#### Main research areas:
- Malware detection and analysis using ML / AI algorithms.
- Security of public and private blockchain platforms.

#### Description of the research

Cybersec Lab is focus on the area of ​​Security of Public and Private Blockchain Platforms, including analysis of selected mechanisms for obtaining consensus in distributed blockchain networks: proof of work, proof of stake, proof of burn, proof of space. We analyze also the security of blockchain technology applications (including the problem of transaction tracking in the network Monero, which was created in response to Bitcoin restrictions). Research also covers the security issue and performance for the Hyperledger Iroha, Sawtooth PoET and Hyperledger Fabric platforms. For the area of ​​Malware detection and analysis using ML / AI algorithms. We analyze the effectiveness of malware detection using static analysis techniques and application code using the AI/ML algorithms.
